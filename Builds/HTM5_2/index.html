    <p>The Orbital Stability of an orbit is defined by how long how long an object in the orbit is able to maintain the same predictable path. For example a planet orbiting a star may be able to maintain its orbit for billions of years making the orbit very stable. On the other hand a satellite placed between the sun and the earth may only take sever weeks before corrections must be made to maintain the orbit.
<br><br>The Stability of orbits is an important factor in deciding where satellites are placed as well as determining what we can expect to happen to objects in space over a long period of time.
<br><br><b>Controls:</b>
<br>-Use the slider on the top right to control the speed of the simulation
<br>-Right click and drag to move the camera
<br>-Use scroll wheel while hovering mouse over simulation to zoom in and out
<br>-Use the buttons at the bottom to navigate
<br>-Click on the Part 1 button to start

   <p><b>Information about the simulation:</b><br>
-All objects are to scale when zoomed in (if they would be too small to see on screen the visible size is increased as needed)
<br>-Physics Calculations take place 21600 times a second (i.e. once every 4 simulated seconds when running at 1 day/s, and once every 100 seconds when running at 25 days/s)
<br>-If the simulation isn't able to do all the calculations it needs, the time real-time clock will slow down
<br>-Running at higher speeds will make the simulation less accurate (shouldn't really be a problem) but will not be more intensive on the computer because the number of physics steps per second is constant. 
<br>-All position velocity, radius information are calculated using double precision numbers (15 significant digits, with exponent component ranging 10 to the +/- 308 power
<br>-Due to the nature of how the calculations are done they are not perfectly accurate and will accumulate error over time, especially if running at higher speeds.
<br>-All calculations take place in 3D but i placed everything in 2D because its makes it easier to see and because the visuals can only display in 2D
<br>-All physics engine and gravity code was writen by me (Pushpinder)
